### Day 2: Friday March 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned the basics of JavaScript object and how to make a constructor. push some of my projects to github to practice my knowledge that i learned learning git and github

**Thoughts:** I hope i can be consistent so that i can push and learn more programming. it's so tiring if you got no motivation to learn and to code

### Day 1: Sunday September 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Learned the basics of terminal again and familiarizing myself again using git and github

**Thoughts:** It's been so long since i've use this site and code because of 4 month break but now i am now willing to learn the basics again even though i'm struggling to recover my passion and excitement in web development or let's say programming in general.
