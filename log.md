# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday January 24, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Watch and Read how internet works. Reviewed html tags on anki and read CSS gradients today. Joined 100 days of code and it helps me motivate unlike before.

**Thoughts:** Im getting confused sometimes because of too much information i am reading about css but im taking a rest and explore about the certain topic. 


**Today's Progress**: Studied CSS list and positions. Finished HTML and CSS homework exercises.

**Thoughts:** Positioning and styling a website element is hard and exhausting. I hope i can be better at web development.
