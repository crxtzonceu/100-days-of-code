### Day 2: Friday March 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned the basics of JavaScript object and how to make a constructor. push some of my projects to github to practice my knowledge that i learned learning git and github

** Thoughts:** I hope i can be consistent so that i can push and learn more programming. it's so tiring if you got no motivation to learn and to code
